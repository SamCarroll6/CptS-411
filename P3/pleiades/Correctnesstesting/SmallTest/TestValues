N and p are variable (described along with n, which is not variable, in each description for the file storing the final results. Results are sorted using shell call:
	 cat <slurmfile> | sort -V > filename
Values for small test are:
	seed =  700 
	A    =  5498 
        B    =  250
	Prime = 7283 
	n    =  64
These are used with varying processor counts to check correctness across different numbers of processors being used.
