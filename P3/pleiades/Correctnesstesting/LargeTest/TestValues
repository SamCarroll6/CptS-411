N and p are variable (described along with n, which is not variable, in each description for the file storing the final results. Results are sorted using shell call:
	 cat <slurmfile> | sort -V > filename
Values for large test are:
	seed =  23 
	A    =  1000 
        B    =  38 
	Prime = 9142 
	n    =  200000
These are used with varying processor counts to check correctness across different numbers of processors being used.
